# PopularMovies
ad-nanodegree project
This is the first part of the Popular Movies app for the Udacity android developer Nanodegree. The app requests for data from themoviedb.org

In this app I used loopj async-http (https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) library to handle sending of requests 

<h4>Extra Note</h4>
In order to use the moviedb api, after cloning this repo, get your own api-key and insert it on line 27 of MainActivity class like this:
<code>public static final String API_KEY = "replace with your api-key";</code>
